This is a numbered conversation analysis example:

\begin{conan}[Anton] % specify the longest speaker name if it has more than one character
	\alone{Anton}{And that that actually the choice they made will be subjected}
	\simul{}{to who's doing [ the ] the choose yes }{Lisa}{[ The choosing ] }
	\simul{Lisa}{It subjects to availability and who to make [ choice }{Anton}{[ Yes }
\end{conan}

This is a \texttt{conan} environment without example numbering:

\begin{conan*}
	\alone{A}{And that that actually the choice they made will be subjected to }
	\simul{}{who's doing [ the ] the choose yes }{Z}{[ The choosing ]}
\end{conan*}
